SideProject
===========

A 2D DirectX9 game written in C++ that I'm working on with a group of friends and former classmates. The project uses a custom built framework that I created to handle everything from Input management, Rendering through DirectX, Event dispatching, and Texture management.

As the lead programmer on the project, I oversee all aspects of the development process. This involves doing code-reviews, integrating systems, and updating and maintaining the existing framework to accomodate the demands of the project.
